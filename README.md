# AI-based Diabetic Patient Management
## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic condition that is becoming increasingly prevalent in Pakistan, posing a significant public health challenge. One of its most serious complications is Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU), which, if left untreated, is a leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputations. Globally, DFUs are responsible for nearly 85% of such amputations. In Pakistan, many patients with DFUs require long-term self-care to aid in healing and prevent further deterioration. Unfortunately, when DFUs are not managed properly, patients may be forced to undergo amputation to save their lives.<br>Our proposed solution is a mobile app tailored for Pakistan, leveraging AI-driven deep learning to detect DFUs through Object detection and instance segmentation. The app would provide reports to doctors and offer personalised recommendations to patients and healthcare providers. This approach would enable patients to manage their condition more effectively from home, staying connected with their healthcare team remotely and reducing the need for frequent hospital visits. Daily reminders and virtual support would help raise patient awareness and foster greater independence, improving DFU care in Pakistan.

## Project Overview

Our final year project (FYP) focuses on creating a mobile application that leverages deep learning to assist in treating diabetic foot ulcers and retinopathy for diabetic patients. This project aims to provide impactful solutions that utilise data to improve patient outcomes.
