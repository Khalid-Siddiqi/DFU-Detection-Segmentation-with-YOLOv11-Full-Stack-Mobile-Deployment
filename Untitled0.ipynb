        "\n",
        "The model processes images with an average inference time of approximately 83 milliseconds per image, making it highly efficient and suitable for real-time applications.\n",
        "The additional preprocessing and postprocessing steps collectively take less than 2 milliseconds, ensuring the app's responsiveness.\n",
        "User Feedback:\n",
        "\n",
        "Users have praised the app's intuitive interface and reliable performance.\n",
        "Feedback highlighted the need for additional features like enhanced visualization tools (e.g., better highlighting of ulcer boundaries) and detailed reporting capabilities to provide users with more insights into their condition.\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
